    <img src="../images/cowboycaviar.webp" alt="Picture of the completed dish">
    <p>Here is an example of cowboy caviar and if you're luckier than me yours might turn out like this. 
        I hope you enjoy your meal!
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditionally, cowboy caviar is served as an appetizer with tortilla chips. 
        But that's not the only way to enjoy this Southern staple! You can also serve it as a 
        light salad alongside your dinner or you can make it a meal by layering it with rice or 
        lettuce.
